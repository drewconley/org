title:  "Hit It Again"
---

I have a million projects on my plate, and the list continues to grow because I always want to start over. I suffer from this terrible epidemic called SOS: shiny object syndrome. New things get me excited about the future, but drift my focus away from the present.

I get caught up in new web technology, so I’ll restart my project with a new JavaScript framework or design direction. I hear new music and fall in love with the sound, so I’ll try to write a whole album in that style. I get inspired by a book or blog, so I’ll read over my old authored drafts and decide, “Meh. I can do better”.

This realization hit me pretty hard in January when I wrote my annual reflection journal. My list of accomplishments was fairly long, but they were mostly checkmarks in self-study or practice... I learned a ton yet hardly finished **any** concrete projects. No implementation could keep my attention long enough.

Why start over? A few things came to mind:

**It’s easy to start over when you’re working alone.** The bar isn’t very high when you’re the only stakeholder. I’ll be too tired to work and neglect the project over time. It’s 100% my own thing, so who would notice? The project feels stale when/if I pick it up again, so I’ll just start over to have it feel fresh. (I recently noticed this while working with a friend on a web project. It is far more fulfilling and way easier to stay motivated with two hearts in the project.)

**Quality is a risky obsession.** If you’re trying to get out the door quickly, quality is the painful glass door that you never see coming. The early honeymoon days of a project are my favorite. Everything is in draft stage, so the shortcomings are no big deal. “Don’t worry, I’ll nail that in the final version”. I do this with my guitar solos, vocal takes, verse lyrics, CSS rules, JavaScript bugs, file structures, design shortcomings, and these blog posts. I have visions of the final versions in my head, and they are beautiful. Reality sinks in and the quality of my actual "final versions" don’t hold up to the immaculate versions in my head. I’ll start over to get it right, thus the cycle repeats.

An old mentor of mine runs a recording studio in St. Louis. He used to say, “Songs are never finished. They are only abandoned”. 

Finally, the big reason:

**The whole thing might totally flop.** It hurts to fail.

Sure, failing is great because it makes you smarter/stronger/faster/better, but jeez, it really burns. As much as I love creating products that aren’t used, writing songs that aren’t heard, and trying other things that makes me look like an idiot, I’d rather spend my time at the safe drawing board.  I prolong failure by starting over again and again.
