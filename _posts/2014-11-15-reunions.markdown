Lauren and I are going to a wedding today. Two of my longtime friends since high school are finally tying the knot! I couldn't be happier for them.

Tonight will be an opportunity to reconnect with many friends I've lost touch with over the past five years. So much has changed, and I'm not sure where most of the friendships were left off. Some of them don't even know that I met and married the girl of my dreams. Yet, we were such good friends not so long ago. Maybe they went off and got married too, I just haven't heard about it!

One of my goals for the night is to avoid **reversion**, where one "reverts" back to an old personality from the past. Reversion is triggered during interaction with past enviornments. If you hang out with your old high school friends, you may find yourself acting like the person you were in high school. Saying the same things, thinking the same thoughts, trying to impress the same people, being "that guy" again.

I'm not ashamed of my old self, but I have grown up quite a bit in the past five years. Who hasn't? I'm just going to be my new self and have a great time celebrating the love of two friends. Congrats Jake & Katie!
