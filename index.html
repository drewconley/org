    <h2>Me in 5 seconds</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I'm a Web Developer and Music Teacher from St. Louis, MO.</li>
        <li>I make apps, interactive websites, and guitar-driven music.</li>
        <li>Each day is a new day to create something fun and/or useful.</li>
        <li>When I'm not creating stuff, I'm reading books, jamming with friends, or hanging out with my gorgeous wife.</li>
        <li>Myers-Briggs: ESFP</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Goals</h2>
    <p>I know I've had a great day when I was able to contribute to a project, teach something new to an excited student, or learn something new myself. I grew up as a musician, so most of my web projects intend to help musicians in the creative process and promotion. I have the honor of working with many talented young guitar students, so anything I can do to push them forward is a success in my book. I'm also trying to teach my dog how to roll over.</p>
    
    <h2>I'm a Web Developer</h2>
    <p>Front end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are my speciality. I'm all about tight presentation layers and interactive UI in the name of good UX. My favorite language to write is JavaScript because of its wide range of use cases, but I also really love Ruby. <del>Angular</del> React is my library of choice for JavaScript applications, but I'm always trying new things :) </p>

    <h2>...and I Teach Guitar</h2>
    <p>I started casually teaching others to play in high school but it slowly grew to a busy side business. The coolest feeling in the world for me is empowering the musically inspired to become real musicians. Learning to write songs was pretty painful for me when growing up, so I try to make it easier for people.</p>
