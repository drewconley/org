    <h2>Me in 5 seconds</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I'm a Web Developer and Music Teacher from St. Louis, MO.</li>
        <li>Each day is a new day to create something fun and/or useful.</li>
        <li>When I'm not creating stuff, I'm reading books, jamming with friends, or hanging out with my gorgeous wife.</li>
        <li>Myers-Briggs: ESFP</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Goals</h2>
    <p>I know I've had a great day when I was able to contribute to a project, teach something new to an excited student, or learn something new myself. I grew up as a musician, so most of my web projects intend to help musicians in the creative process and promotion. I have the honor of working with many talented young guitar students, so anything I can do to push them forward is a success in my book. I'm also trying to teach my dog how to roll over.</p>

    <h2>Posts</h2>
    <ul class="posts">
    {% for post in site.posts %}

        <a class="post-link" href="{{ post.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
